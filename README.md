# TOP HUMAN LANGUAGES

When developing products or services that are destined for world-wide distribution, one naturally must consider which languages that should be supported. As there are over 6000 known languages; supporting all of them would be nearly impossible. Even supporting 100 would be incredibly expensive and difficult.

So, which languages should be chosen?

Ultimately, such a decision is very likely unique for each product or service. But this project and repository is designed to give you a starting point. A list of languages to support based on real-world numbers and a predictable formula, even if said formula has arbitrary weight given to it.

To start with the results:

## TOP 3 LANGUAGES

|Language | code |
| --- | --- |
|English   |  en|
|Mandarin Chinese   |     zh|
|Spanish   |  es|


## TOP 10 LANGUAGES

|Language | code |
| --- | --- |
|English   |  en|
|Mandarin Chinese   |     zh|

|Hindi     |  hi|
|Russian   |  ru|
|Portuguese  |    pt|
|French    |  fr|
|Bengali   |  bn|
|German    |  de|
|Japanese   |     ja|


## THE DETAILS

Most of the details are spelled out in the spreadsheet labeled `calculations.ods`.

But, in general, four different weight are assigned to each language:

### 15% : native speaker count

Weighs the languages in favor of many fluent speakers.

### 50% : total speaker count

Weighs the languages in favor reaching people in general. So, this includes both native speakers and speakers who speak the language as a second language.

### 10% : web content

Weighs the languages in favor of where current web authors have felt compelled to provide content to reach readers for a variety of reasons.

### 25% : PPP GDP

Weighs the languages in favor of the economic impact of the language.
