The following 4 items, given the following weights for an average:

    15% : native speaker count

        Weights the list in favor of many fluent speakers.

    50% : total speaker count

        Weights the list in favor reaching people in general.

    10% : web content

        Weights the list in favor of where current web authors have felt
           compelled to provide content to reach readers for a variety
           of reasons.

    25% : country per-capita PPP GDP
       (where predominant language is fully assigned to country)

        Weights the list in favor of the economic impact of the language.

The list is sorted and then trimmed to match:

    Top N%: top entries to reach N% of total speaker count
    Top 50%: the list expanded to reach 50% of total speaker count
