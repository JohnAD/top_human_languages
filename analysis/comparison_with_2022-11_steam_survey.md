## Analysis

English/Chinese still at top; but spanish is 4th not 3rd at Steam.

Hindi, Bengali are missing from the list.

Arabic is at bottom of the steam list, not 4th.

### Why no Hindi?

I found some opinions on the Internet. The most common one: English is already known.

from Reddit https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianGaming/comments/vittpu/why_games_arent_dubbed_in_indian_languages/

> "I think, because most Indian understand English enough, There is no need for a Hindi dub."

> "English is the most Indian language ever as far as games are concerned. It may rub some the wrong way, but those who dont speak English are unlikely to play games, let alone buy them. Apart from that, most dialogues in games wont translate well in any of the Indian languages, but we under English expressions just fine. And language and localization is for accessibility of the product. But for us Indians language is nowhere near the top barrier that prevents games from being accessible. Even if a game could translate to the remaining 21 official languages, it would barely make any difference in terms of accessibility."

> "Looking at the horrible dubbing of English movies in Hindi (I only know Hindi as another language so comparing with that only). It’s best they don’t do that cringy and hideous dialogue delivery for videogames. We are fine with English.
>
> Ask yourself, have your ever seen a satisfactory dub of a Hollywood movie in Hindi? The tone and pitch is always out of place, there is no expression and often forceful cringe comedy."

### Why no Bengali?

Not sure at all. My Internet searches were unsuccessful.

### Why so little Arabic?

Internet searches tend to say that such translation is very difficult to pull off:

* cultural conflict with game content
* RTL layout (many studios historically showing the characters backwards)
* mistranslation due to gender ambiguities
* overtranslation (where things should actually remain in English); for example "Save" and "Load" should stay in English
